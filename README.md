# School District Analysis

## Overview of school district analysis
The aim of this project is to analyze math and reading performance from 15 high schools within the school district. Variables potentially associated with overall school performance include school budget, size of student body, and district vs. charter school type. 
There was also a concern that some scores within the 9th grade class at Thomas High School had been altered. The analyses were repeated after removing this group of students.


## Results

  First summary scores for the entire district were generated.
